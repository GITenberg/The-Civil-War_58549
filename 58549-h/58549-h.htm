<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>Thousands of student requests for information on the Civil War
prompted the publication of this booklet. Its purpose is to present in
simple language a survey of the eleven most popular aspects of the
1861-1865 conflict. This guide is intended as a supplement, not a substitute,
for American history textbooks.</p>
<p>Space limitations prevented mention of each of the 6,000 engagements
of the Civil War. Thus, while such actions as the battle of
Picacho Pass, Ariz., and Quantrill&rsquo;s sacking of Lawrence, Kan., had
import for their particular locales, they of necessity had to be omitted.
In those battles herein discussed, statistics for armies and losses are those
generally accepted. The map midway in the booklet may help familiarize
the student with the various theaters of military operations. After
each section is a list of works recommended for those who desire more
detailed information on the subject.</p>
<p>Relatively little consideration of the political, economic, and social
history of the period was possible within the limits of this small work.
However, the Commission can supply upon request and without charge
the following pamphlets treating in part of those subjects: <i>Emancipation
Centennial, 1962: A Brief Anthology of the Preliminary Proclamation</i>;
<i>Free Homesteads for All Americans: The Homestead Act of
1862</i>, by Paul W. Gates; <i>The Origins of the Land-Grant Colleges and
State Universities</i>, by Allan Nevins; and <i>Our Women of the Sixties</i>,
by Sylvia G. L. Dannett and Katharine M. Jones.</p>
<p>The Commission is deeply indebted to the Editorial Advisory Board
members, each of whom rendered valuable assistance toward the final
draft of the narrative.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">I. CAUSES OF THE CIVIL WAR</span></h2>
<p>Historians past and present disagree sharply over the major cause
of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Some writers have viewed the struggle of the 1860&rsquo;s as a &ldquo;war of
rebellion&rdquo; brought on by a &ldquo;slavepower conspiracy.&rdquo; To them it was
a conflict between Northern &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; and Southern &ldquo;barbarism.&rdquo;
James Ford Rhodes, who dealt more generously with the South than
did many other Northern writers of his time, stated in 1913: &ldquo;Of the
American Civil War it may safely be asserted that there was a single
cause, slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other historians, such as Charles A. Beard and Harold U. Faulkner,
have argued that slavery was only the surface issue. The real cause,
these men state, was &ldquo;the economic forces let loose by the Industrial
Revolution&rdquo; then taking place in the North. These economic forces
were strong, powerful, and &ldquo;beating irresistibly upon a one-sided and
rather static&rdquo; Southern way of life. Therefore, the 1860&rsquo;s produced a
&ldquo;second American Revolution,&rdquo; fought between the &ldquo;capitalists, laborers,
and farmers of the North and West&rdquo; on the one hand, and the
&ldquo;planting aristocracy of the South&rdquo; on the other.</p>
<p>A third theory advanced by historians is that the threat to states&rsquo;
rights led to war. The conflict of the 1860&rsquo;s was thus a &ldquo;War between
the States.&rdquo; Many in this group believe that the U. S. Constitution of
1787 was but a compact, or agreement, between the independent states.
Therefore, when a state did not like the policies of the central government,
it had the right to withdraw&mdash;or secede&mdash;from this compact.</p>
<p>Still other writers believe &ldquo;Southern nationalism&rdquo; to have been the
basic cause of the war. Southerners, they assert, had so strong a desire
to preserve their particular way of life that they were willing to fight.
This then became a struggle between rival sections whose differences
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
could not be settled peacefully. The result was a &ldquo;War for Southern
Independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">Slaves working in a field across the river from Montgomery, Ala.,
first capital of the Confederacy.</p>
</div>
<p>A recent group of historians, known as &ldquo;revisionists,&rdquo; rejects these
earlier theories. Leader of the revisionist school was the late James G.
Randall, who once stated: &ldquo;If one word or phrase were selected to
account for the war, that word would not be slavery, or economic
grievances, or states rights, or diverse civilizations. It would have to
be such a word as fanaticism.&rdquo; Another revisionist, Avery O. Craven,
agrees. The Civil War, he wrote, resulted because the great mass of
American people &ldquo;permitted their short-sighted politicians, their overzealous
editors, and their pious reformers&rdquo; to control public opinion
and action. Primarily through the slavery issue, these radicals created
more and more hatred between North and South. In the end, and as a
result of these radicals, the differences between the sections, swelled by
&ldquo;a blundering generation,&rdquo; burst into a war.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">II. ADVANTAGES OF NORTH AND SOUTH</span></h2>
<p>Few nations have been as unprepared for a full-scale war as was
the United States in 1861. The U. S. Army consisted of barely 17,000
men. Most of the soldiers were stationed at remote outposts on the
western frontier. To make matters worse for the Union, a large number
of army officers who had been born in the South and educated at
West Point resigned from the army and offered their services to the
Confederacy.</p>
<p>The U. S. Navy was in an equally bad state. It had performed
little duty since the War of 1812. The Navy had a total of 90 ships,
but only 42 of them were in active service at the outbreak of civil war.
Of this number, 11 fell into Confederate hands with the capture of the
naval base at Norfolk, Va., in April, 1861. The remaining vessels were
scattered around the world. Moreover, 230 of 1,400 naval officers
joined the forces of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Civil War, the North seemed to possess
every advantage:</p>
<p>(1) 23 Northern states aligned against only 11 Southern states.
(Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri were slave states, but they remained
in the Union. Also, the western counties of Virginia revolted and
formed their own state when the Old Dominion cast her lot with the
Confederacy.)</p>
<p>(2) The population of the Northern states was approximately
22,000,000 people. The Southern states had only 9,105,000 people, and
one-third of them (3,654,000) were slaves. The great difference in
population, plus a steady flow of European immigrants into the Northern
states, gave the Union tremendous manpower. Over 2,000,000 men
served in the Federal armies, while no more than half that number
fought for the South.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="420" />
<p class="pcap">The &ldquo;General Haupt&rdquo; was one of several locomotives seized by Federals on
the Orange &amp; Alexandria (now Southern) Railroad.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>(3) The North had 110,000 manufacturing plants, as compared
with 18,000 in the Confederate States. The North produced 97% of
all firearms in America, and it manufactured 96% of the nation&rsquo;s
railroad equipment.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="369" />
<p class="pcap">Although the South possessed few manufacturing plants in 1861, Richmond&rsquo;s
Tredegar Iron Works produced such items as machinery, cannon, submarines,
torpedoes, and plates for ironclad ships.</p>
</div>
<p>(4) Most of the country&rsquo;s financial resources were in the North.</p>
<p>In view of the North&rsquo;s statistical superiority in so many areas,
people often do not understand how the Civil War lasted four long
years. Many reasons account for this:</p>
<p>(1) Both North and South needed many months of preparation
before they were ready for full-scale war.</p>
<p>(2) For at least the first eighteen months of the war, the Confederacy
was able to obtain many supplies from sympathetic nations in
Europe. Not until late in 1862 did the Federals have enough ships to
blockade effectively the major Southern ports.</p>
<p>(3) Southern armies generally fought on the defensive. It does
not require as many men to hold a position as it does to attack and
seize that position.</p>
<p>(4) Moreover, every time the Federals captured a city, bridge,
road junction, or other important point, men had to be left behind to
guard these places. To the Northern armies also went the task of sheltering,
feeding, and to some extent training thousands of freed or
runaway slaves. Therefore, even though the Federal armies greatly outnumbered
the Confederate forces, the North needed more men to fight
the war.</p>
<p>(5) In that age armies rarely fought in wintertime, a season of
cold weather and deep mud. Most of the military campaigns took place
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
between April and October. Hence, little activity occurred for about
half of each year.</p>
<p>Before surveying the military campaigns, the student should bear
in mind two more important, but somewhat confusing, points: each
side named its armies by different systems, and each side used different
methods for identifying battles.</p>
<p>The North named its armies for large rivers, while the South designated
its forces by large areas of land. For example, the Federal Army
of the Potomac fought against the Confederate Army of Northern
Virginia. This difference of names could and did sometimes become
perplexing. An illustration of this occurred in the Western theater,
where the Federal Army of the Tennessee (river) campaigned against
the Confederate Army of Tennessee (state).</p>
<p>Likewise, both sides used different methods in naming battles. The
North referred to a battle by the closest stream, river, run, or creek in
the area. The South designated a battle by the name of the nearest
town. Thus, the bloodiest one-day engagement of the Civil War is
known in the North as the battle of Antietam Creek, and in the South
as the battle of Sharpsburg, Maryland. In some cases, such as the battles
of Gettysburg and Wilson&rsquo;s Creek, both sides adopted the same name.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the war itself and &ldquo;follow the armies.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">III. MILITARY CAMPAIGNS</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4">1861</h3>
<p>Late in April, 1861, the Confederate government moved its capital
from Montgomery, Ala., to Richmond, Va. This transfer was intended
to bind Virginia closer to the other Southern states and to put the
Confederate government nearer Washington when the time came to
discuss the peace treaty. In reality the move backfired. It made Richmond
the primary Federal target and Virginia the major battleground
of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Few engagements occurred in 1861, when neither North nor South
had a highly organized, efficient army. What both sides in 1861 called
armies were more like armed and unruly mobs. Yet President Lincoln
and the Congress, hoping to end the war quickly, were anxious to capture
Richmond.</p>
<p>As a result, Federal forces made three thrusts into Virginia. They
first moved from Ohio into the pro-Northern counties of western Virginia,
where Confederate regiments as &ldquo;green&rdquo; as the Federal units were
stationed. In a series of small battles, including Philippi (June 3), Rich
Mountain (July 11), and Corrick&rsquo;s Ford (July 13), the Federals were
victorious. In 1863 this region entered the Union as the loyal state of
West Virginia.</p>
<p>The other two Federal invasions were
less successful. The main Virginia defenses
stretched from Norfolk northward to the
Potomac River, thence westward to Harpers
Ferry. Early in June, Gen. Benjamin
F. Butler left Fort Monroe with a Federal
force and struck at Richmond by way of
the peninsula between the James and York
rivers. At Big Bethel Church, just west of
Yorktown, Confederates attacked and sent
Butler&rsquo;s men stampeding back to their base
at Fort Monroe.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Benjamin F. Butler, a politician
with little military
experience, led two ill-fated
campaigns against Richmond.</p>
</div>
<p>The third and main Federal push into
Virginia resulted in the largest battle
fought in 1861. In mid-July, Gen. Irvin
McDowell moved from Washington with
some 35,000 recruits. McDowell&rsquo;s ultimate
target was Richmond, but first he had to capture the important railroad
junction of Manassas. Through espionage agents the Confederates
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
learned of McDowell&rsquo;s advance. Quickly
Gens. P. G. T. Beauregard and Joseph E.
Johnston concentrated 30,000 Southern
troops near Manassas to block the Federal
move. On a very hot Sunday, July 21,
McDowell attacked Beauregard and Johnston
near a stream known as Bull Run.
As in the case of many Civil War battles,
the main attack was against the flank (or
end) of the line, while for deception a
lesser assault force struck at the center of
the defending force&rsquo;s position.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="430" />
<p class="pcap">A great-nephew of Patrick
Henry, &ldquo;Uncle Joe&rdquo; Johnston
proved a superb army commander.
Yet he and President
Davis had too many
personal and official differences
during the war.</p>
</div>
<p>The Federals might have won a smashing
victory that day but for a stubborn
brigade of Virginians under Gen. Thomas
J. Jackson. The refusal of Jackson and his
men to give ground not only helped save
the day for the South but also earned for that general and his brigade
the name &ldquo;Stonewall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Losses in the battle of First Manassas, or First Bull Run, were much
less than those in the larger battles to come. The Federals lost 2,896
men killed, wounded, and missing. The Confederates suffered 1,982
casualties.</p>
<p>This battle at Manassas had several important effects. Southerners
were convinced that Yankees were poor fighters, and that the war
would be brief. On the other hand, Northerners realized that defeating
the Confederacy would take longer than anticipated. Thus, while
Southerners celebrated a great victory, the North began raising and
equipping large armies for full-scale war.</p>
<p>A month later occurred an engagement in the West. On August
10, a Federal army sought out and attacked a Confederate force at
Wilson&rsquo;s Creek, near Springfield, Mo. In this battle, often called &ldquo;Bull
Run of the West,&rdquo; the Federals met defeat. The Union commander,
Gen. Nathaniel Lyon, was killed in the midst of the fighting.</p>
<p>On October 21, the North suffered another costly setback. Near
Ball&rsquo;s Bluff, Va., Confederate defenders all but annihilated a Federal
scouting force. The &ldquo;Ball&rsquo;s Bluff disaster&rdquo; spurred into action the
&ldquo;Committee on the Conduct of the War.&rdquo; Seven U. S. congressmen
made up this investigating body. Although not one had had army
training, they continually inquired into the military affairs of every
Federal army and often embarrassed generals in the field.</p>
<p>While Confederates in 1861 won most of the battles, Lincoln and
his government by no means felt defeated. Gen. George B. McClellan
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
was building an army at Washington that would soon number 100,000
volunteer troops. This force would be the largest ever amassed in the
Western Hemisphere up to that time. Moreover, the North had won a
few victories. On November 7, a Federal amphibious force had captured
Port Royal, S. C., thus gaining a beachhead on the South Atlantic
coast. Yet on that same day, another Federal army suffered defeat at
Belmont, Mo. The losing general was an unknown officer from Illinois,
and this was his first Civil War battle. His name was Ulysses S. Grant.</p>
<h3 id="c5">1862 IN THE WEST</h3>
<p>War&rsquo;s full fury struck in 1862. To understand the complicated
movements of many armies, bear in mind two points:</p>
<p>(1) Not one, but <i>two</i>, separate areas of military operations existed.
The Appalachian Mountains, extending in an almost unbroken line
from Pennsylvania to Alabama, prevented armies from moving freely
from eastern states (Virginia, the Carolinas, etc.) to western or trans-Appalachian
states (Tennessee, Kentucky, etc.), and <i>vice versa</i>. As a
result, different armies in the East (east of the mountains) and in the
West fought practically two almost independent wars. Only in 1864
were the campaigns of the two areas effectively coordinated.</p>
<p>(2) In the 1800&rsquo;s, in contrast to modern military tactics, an invading
army did not always move directly against an enemy force.
Rather, its primary target was usually an important city. Once the
invading army was in motion, the defending force then tried to place
itself between the invader and his target. This set the stage for battle.
Five such Confederate cities became principal Federal targets. In the
East was Richmond; in the West were New Orleans and Vicksburg,
both strongholds on the all-important Mississippi River, and Chattanooga
and Atlanta, vital railroad centers.</p>
<p>Bearing these two points in mind, let us turn to the Western campaigns
of 1862.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the beginning of 1862 some 48,000 Confederate soldiers guarded
a 600-mile line extending from the Appalachian Mountains westward
to the Mississippi River. Obviously the Southern defenses were thinly
manned. Early in February, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant left Cairo, Ill., with
15,000 men to attack the center of this line. His goal was to gain control
of two important rivers, the Tennessee and the Cumberland.</p>
<p>To protect these streams, the Confederates had constructed twin
forts in Tennessee just south of the Kentucky border. Fort Henry
guarded the Tennessee; Fort Donelson stood menacingly on the banks
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of the Cumberland. On February 6 a Federal river fleet cooperating
with Grant battered Fort Henry into submission. Ten days later Grant
had surrounded Fort Donelson and its 12,000 defenders. Answering the
Confederate commander&rsquo;s request for surrender terms, Grant replied:
&ldquo;No terms but unconditional surrender.&rdquo; Thereafter, U. S. Grant was
&ldquo;Unconditional Surrender&rdquo; Grant.</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s victories brought great rejoicing in the North. Some writers
consider the Henry-Donelson campaign as &ldquo;the critical operation&rdquo;
of the Civil War. Capture of these forts assured Union control of
Kentucky and Tennessee and opened Mississippi and Alabama to Federal
invasion. The loss of the forts was a severe blow to Southern morale.
With these successes the North had also demonstrated its ability and
willingness to fight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an important battle occurred farther to the west for
control of Arkansas and Missouri. On March 7-8, at Pea Ridge (or
Elkhorn Tavern), Ark., a Confederate army of 16,000 men attacked
12,000 Federals under Gen. Samuel R. Curtis. Most of the Confederates
lacked uniforms and were armed with shotguns and squirrel rifles. This
force also included 3,500 Indians of the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee,
Chickasaw and Seminole tribes. After two days of fighting, a Federal
counterattack broke the Confederate &ldquo;army.&rdquo; With the defeat at
Pea Ridge the Confederates permanently lost Missouri and northern
Arkansas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="356" />
<p class="pcap">Gunfire and fighting at Shiloh was so intense that one area of the battlefield
became known as the &ldquo;Hornet&rsquo;s Nest.&rdquo; This drawing depicts the stubborn
resistance of two Federal divisions in that area.</p>
</div>
<p>By the end of March Grant&rsquo;s army was near the Mississippi border.
Just across the line Gens. Albert Sidney Johnston and Beauregard had
collected a force of 40,000 Confederates. Even though most of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
troops were ill-equipped, Johnston attacked Grant&rsquo;s encamped forces
in an effort to destroy the Federal invaders. The battle of Shiloh (April
6-7), one of the war&rsquo;s most costly engagements, followed.</p>
<p>The initial Confederate attack caught Grant by surprise, bent his
line, but never broke it. Several events then swung the battle to the
North&rsquo;s favor. Gen. Johnston bled to death from a leg wound. Exhaustion
and disorganization blunted the drive of the Southerners, and
Federal artillery posted in great strength near the Tennessee River
proved an effective barrier to the Confederate advance. Heavy Federal
reinforcements under Gen. Don C. Buell arrived during the night.
The next morning Grant counterattacked. The Confederates retreated
grudgingly to Corinth, thus ending the battle. Grant&rsquo;s hard-won victory
cost him 13,047 casualties. The Confederates lost 10,694 soldiers,
roughly one-fourth of Johnston&rsquo;s forces.</p>
<p>For the next four months the armies of Grant and Bragg (who
eventually succeeded to command) did not meet in battle. However,
three significant events took place elsewhere in the Western theater.</p>
<p>One was the Federal capture of the mouth of the Mississippi River.
In April a fleet under Flag Officer David G. Farragut blasted its way
upriver past Forts Jackson and St. Philip. By the end of May the strategic
river cities of New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Natchez were under
Federal control. Yet a river attack on Vicksburg failed.</p>
<p>The second event was one of the boldest raids in American history.
In April James J. Andrews, a Federal espionage agent, and twenty-one
Northern soldiers sneaked through Confederate territory to Big Shanty
Station, Ga., only thirty miles from Atlanta. There they stole the
engine &ldquo;General&rdquo; and two cars of a Western &amp; Atlantic passenger train.
The Federals&rsquo; plan was to race up the tracks to Chattanooga, removing
rails, burning bridges, and thus ruining this important line.</p>
<p>The coup might have succeeded but for the perseverance of a
handful of citizens and soldiers, who gave immediate pursuit on foot,
by handcar, and eventually on an engine (&ldquo;The Texas&rdquo;) running in
reverse. All of the raiders were soon captured. Andrews and seven of
his men were subsequently hanged in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Southern raiders soon gained a measure of revenge. In July, 1862,
Col. John Hunt Morgan led his Confederate cavalrymen on a two-week
slash through Kentucky. Morgan won four small battles, captured
1,200 Federals, and returned safely to Tennessee with less than 100
casualties. In December Morgan again struck into Kentucky. This
&ldquo;Christmas Raid&rdquo; netted 1,900 prisoners and large quantities of horses
and military stores.</p>
<p>Shortly after Morgan&rsquo;s First Kentucky Raid, Gen. Bragg invaded
the same state. Bragg hoped to occupy the chief cities and, by &ldquo;military
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
persuasion,&rdquo; to bring Kentucky into the Confederacy. Yet caution
eventually got the better of Bragg. He retreated, even after winning
a tactical victory over Gen. Don C. Buell at Perryville on October 8.
This invasion marked the end of Confederate efforts to wrest Kentucky
from the Union.</p>

<p class="pcap">William S. Rosecrans was a tireless,
conscientious officer whom the men affectionately called
&ldquo;Old Rosy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bragg returned to Tennessee. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, who had
gained fame in two Mississippi campaigns, assumed command of the
Federal army opposing Bragg. Then in November Grant started southward
from Tennessee through Mississippi toward Vicksburg, the chief
Confederate stronghold on the &ldquo;Father of Waters.&rdquo; Grant&rsquo;s strategy
called for a two-pronged attack: he and Gen. William T. Sherman
would deliver simultaneous assaults on Vicksburg from different directions.
The plan was a costly failure. Confederate cavalry under Gen.
Earl Van Dorn destroyed Grant&rsquo;s main supply base at Holly Springs.
Grant was forced to fall back to Memphis. Sherman&rsquo;s assaults on December
28-29 at Chickasaw Bayou were repulsed with heavy losses.
Grant then moved his entire army down the Mississippi and prepared
to take Vicksburg by attack or siege.</p>
<p>The final Western engagement of 1862 began on the last day of
the year near Murfreesboro, Tenn. For the better part of four days
Bragg&rsquo;s Confederate army waged a desperate fight along the banks of
Stone&rsquo;s River with Rosecrans&rsquo;s Federal forces. Tactically the battle was
a draw. Yet the Federals lost 31% in killed, wounded, and missing,
while the Confederates suffered 25% casualties.</p>

<h3 id="c6">1862 IN THE EAST</h3>
<p>For seven months McClellan&rsquo;s large
army lay inactive around Washington.
Finally Lincoln, his patience exhausted,
ordered McClellan to advance into Virginia.
McClellan dismissed the dangerous
overland route to Richmond. Rather, he
proposed to transport his forces by water
to Fort Monroe. Thence he would advance
westward on Richmond by way of the
same peninsula where Butler had met defeat
the preceding year. This was the
framework of the Peninsular Campaign.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p08c.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">The creation of the Army
of the Potomac was the
work largely of George B.
McClellan. In 1864 he ran
unsuccessfully as Democratic
candidate for President.</p>
</div>
<p>Lincoln finally agreed to the plan. To
protect Washington, however, he ordered
McDowell&rsquo;s corps of 37,000 soldiers to
remain in the Fredericksburg-Manassas
area.</p>
<p>By April McClellan was on the Virginia peninsula with 105,000
men. In the meantime, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, commanding the
Confederate forces in Virginia, had concentrated his small army on the
peninsula between McClellan and Richmond. McClellan slowly advanced
westward; Johnston, with only 60,000 men, had no choice but
to fall back and fight delaying actions. Driving rains turned the country
into a vast sea of mud. By the end of May McClellan&rsquo;s army had
reached Seven Pines. The spires of Richmond were visible, nine miles
away.</p>
<p>But Seven Pines was as close as McClellan ever got to the Confederate
capital. Johnston noticed that the Federal army had been divided
into two parts by the flooded Chickahominy River. He then launched
attacks against McClellan&rsquo;s left (southern) flank. The muddy battles
of Seven Pines and Fair Oaks (May 31-June 1) permanently halted
McClellan&rsquo;s advance. Johnston was seriously wounded in the fighting,
and Gen. Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Confederate forces
on the Peninsula.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley, Gen. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;
Jackson was performing brilliantly in what became known as the Valley
Campaign. Control of the Valley was vital to both sides. This narrow
slit of land between two ranges of mountains is a direct avenue into
both North and South. Neither side could move safely between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
mountains and the seacoast unless the Valley&rsquo;s
northern door&mdash;the region around
Winchester&mdash;was shut.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">Thomas J. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;
Jackson was a man of both
military genius and peculiar
habits. Known as &ldquo;Old
Jack&rdquo; to his men, he was
probably one of the most
devout soldiers of the war.</p>
</div>
<p>When McClellan moved up the Peninsula,
Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks and another
Federal army advanced southward into the
Valley. Jackson had only 8,500 men at his
command. Yet he was determined to hold
Banks at Winchester and McDowell at
Fredericksburg so as to prevent them from
reinforcing McClellan. On March 23
Jackson attacked part of Banks&rsquo;s army at
Kernstown. The wily Confederate was repulsed,
but his daring prevented Banks
and McDowell from marching to the aid
of McClellan.</p>
<p>Soon three separate Federal armies
entered the Valley for the sole purpose
of destroying Jackson. Reinforced by Gen. Richard S. Ewell&rsquo;s division,
Jackson and his &ldquo;foot cavalry&rdquo; then swung into high gear. The
full impact of &ldquo;Stonewall&rsquo;s&rdquo; successes in the Valley Campaign can be
seen from statistics. Between March 22 and June 9 the Confederates
marched 630 miles, fought 4 major battles and numerous skirmishes,
defeated 3 Federal armies totaling over 60,000 troops, inflicted 7,000
casualties, and captured 10,000 muskets and 9 cannon. Jackson&rsquo;s army,
never exceeding 17,000 men, accomplished all this at a cost of 3 cannon
and 3,100 casualties. And all the while, Jackson kept Washington under
threat of attack.</p>
<p>After a week of rest, Jackson moved
rapidly to Richmond to assist Lee in a new
campaign against McClellan. By then Lee
had verified that McClellan&rsquo;s army was
still dangerously astride the swollen Chickahominy.
The Confederate commander
obtained this information from his colorful
cavalry chief, Gen. J. E. B. &ldquo;Jeb&rdquo;
Stuart, who in mid-June boldly rode all
the way around McClellan&rsquo;s huge army.
On the basis of Stuart&rsquo;s report, Lee attacked
McClellan&rsquo;s exposed right flank
north of the river in the first of a series
of battles known as the Seven Days Campaign.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">A full beard concealed the
fact that &ldquo;Jeb&rdquo; Stuart at
the time of the Peninsular
Campaign was only twenty-nine
years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>On June 26 the Confederates launched their offensive at Mechanicsville,
northeast of Richmond. They suffered defeat from Federal troops
under Gen. FitzJohn Porter. Lee struck again on June 27 and finally
broke the Federal lines at Gaines&rsquo;s Mill after an all-day fight. McClellan
then ordered his army to retire to Harrison&rsquo;s Landing, the Federal supply
base on the James River. Lee&rsquo;s troops tried again and again to destroy
the Federal army. But after hard fighting at Savage Station (June 29),
Frayser&rsquo;s Farm (June 30), White Oak Swamp (June 30), and Malvern
Hill (July 1), McClellan safely reached Harrison&rsquo;s Landing and the
protection of a Federal river fleet. His dream of capturing Richmond
had ended.</p>
<p>In a few weeks another Federal threat confronted Lee. Gen. John
Pope moved overland from Washington with a newly formed army.
His target was also Richmond. Lee shifted his army northward to block
the advance. On August 9 Jackson checked Pope&rsquo;s lead elements at
Cedar Run, a few miles south of Culpeper. Then, while Pope warily
eyed Lee&rsquo;s main force, Jackson&rsquo;s men swept around the Federal right
flank and captured Pope&rsquo;s all-important supply base at Manassas. An
angry Pope turned around and started in pursuit of Jackson.</p>
<p>Pope soon found Jackson. But Gen. James Longstreet, commanding
the other half of Lee&rsquo;s army, found Pope. The August 28-30 campaign
of Second Manassas&mdash;or Second Bull Run&mdash;resulted. As in the
first battle in that area, the Federals met defeat. Pope managed to
check a thrust by Lee at Chantilly (September 1), then retired to
Washington.</p>
<p>Virginia was now clear of Federal forces. The time was ripe, Lee
thought, to invade the North. Success might secure Maryland for the
Confederacy and bring official recognition to the Southern nation from
England and France. Then both foreign powers would send supplies,
and possibly troops, to aid the Southern cause.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s grayclad regiments waded across the Potomac River on September
5, 1862. At Frederick, Md., Lee divided his army. Jackson
marched southward to capture Harpers Ferry and keep the Valley
avenue open, while Lee proceeded westward to Sharpsburg.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p09b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="390" />
<p class="pcap">Harpers Ferry first gained prominence in history with John Brown&rsquo;s 1859 raid.
During the Civil War it was a key point in Eastern military operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Lincoln assigned what was left of Pope&rsquo;s force to
McClellan and sent &ldquo;Little Mac&rdquo; in pursuit of the Confederate invaders.
On September 14 McClellan fought his way through the passes of
South Mountain, Maryland. The next day, as McClellan&rsquo;s troops converged
on Lee, Jackson seized Harpers Ferry. Jackson then hastened
northward and rejoined Lee at Sharpsburg late on September 16.</p>
<p>Wednesday, September 17, produced the largest one-day bloodbath
on American soil. From sunrise until dusk Federal units made repeated
assaults on Lee&rsquo;s lines. Had McClellan thrown his entire army against
Lee&rsquo;s position, the weight of numbers probably would have destroyed
the Army of Northern Virginia. Instead, the Federal commander
shifted his attacks from one sector to another. Casualties mounted
frightfully in such areas as the East Wood, West Wood, Dunker Church,
Sunken Road, and around Burnside&rsquo;s Bridge. By nightfall Lee&rsquo;s battered
army still held its position. McClellan had lost 12,000 men, the
Confederates 9,000.</p>
<p>The battle of Antietam Creek ended Lee&rsquo;s invasion, and he retired
to Virginia. Five days after the engagement, Lincoln issued his preliminary
Emancipation Proclamation. This document promised freedom
to all slaves in Confederate-held territory after January 1, 1863. As
such, it converted the war into a struggle for human freedom and
deterred European nations from granting aid or recognition to the
Confederacy. Many historians therefore maintain that Antietam Creek
and its aftermath were the turning points of the Civil War.</p>
<p>For six weeks after Antietam, McClellan seemed to make little
effort to resume the campaign against Lee. Lincoln tired of waiting;
on November 5 he replaced McClellan with Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not competent to command such a large army,&rdquo; Burnside
stated. He demonstrated this truth in his one battle at the head of the
Army of the Potomac. On December 13, a freezing Saturday, Burnside
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
ordered six grand assaults against Lee&rsquo;s entrenched army on the
heights overlooking Fredericksburg, Va. The result was a useless
slaughter, and a defeated Burnside wept over the killing and wounding
of 10,000 of his men. Confederate losses were less than half that
number.</p>
<p>A few weeks later Burnside attempted a secret march around Lee&rsquo;s
left (western) flank. The Federal army bogged down in winter mud
and made barely a mile a day. This &ldquo;Mud March&rdquo; finished Burnside.
He soon relinquished command to Gen. Joseph Hooker, a strong-willed
officer known to the soldiers as &ldquo;Fighting Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c7">1863 IN THE WEST</h3>
<p>Cavalry raids by both sides occupied the early months of this third
year of conflict. One of the longest was that of Col. Benjamin H.
Grierson and 17,000 Federal horsemen. Leaving La Grange, Tenn., in
April, Grierson&rsquo;s troopers wrecked railroads and supply depots all the
way to Baton Rouge, La. The raid lasted two weeks and helped clear
the way for Grant&rsquo;s campaign against Vicksburg.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

<div class="img" id="fig17">

<p class="pcap">Morgan led an independent group

</div>
<p>On the other hand, Gen. Bedford Forrest and his Confederate
cavalry made a series of quick attacks in Tennessee throughout March
and April. Gen. John Hunt Morgan followed this with a summer foray
through Kentucky, southern Indiana, and across Ohio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Throughout the first half of 1863 Grant slowly tightened the
noose around Vicksburg. Moving down the west bank of the Mississippi
and crossing below Vicksburg, Grant won clear victories at Port
Gibson (May 1), Raymond (May 12), Jackson (May 14), Champion&rsquo;s
Hill (May 16), and Big Black River (May 17). On May 18 Grant
began his siege of Vicksburg itself, and for six weeks the Federals isolated
Gen. John C. Pemberton and his Vicksburg defenders. Confederate
soldiers inside the besieged city eventually found it necessary to
eat rats, mules and grass in an effort to stay alive.</p>
<p>With escape hopeless, Pemberton on July 4 surrendered Vicksburg.
Not only did Grant capture an entire Southern army of 30,000 men,
but the mighty Mississippi, from Minnesota to the Gulf, lay in Federal
hands. The North had severed Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and most of
Louisiana from the Confederacy.</p>
<p>As Grant was accepting the surrender of Vicksburg, Gen. Rosecrans
and his Federal army of 60,000 men were pushing forward in
middle Tennessee. Rosecrans forced Bragg&rsquo;s army of 47,000 Confederates
out of Tullahoma and across the Tennessee River. The Federals
slowly began to envelop the key city of Chattanooga. Bragg, in fear of
being flanked, retreated into Georgia. Rosecrans seized the strategic
rail center, then started in quest of Bragg&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>This brought on the desperate battle of Chickamauga (September
19-20). On the first day Bragg attacked but failed to break Rosecrans&rsquo;s
line. That night Gen. James Longstreet arrived from Lee&rsquo;s army with
fresh Confederate troops. Bragg renewed the attack the following
morning. After several hours of intense fighting, the Confederates
pierced the Federal lines. Rosecrans&rsquo;s right flank, and the general himself,
retreated in disorder to Chattanooga. But the Federal left held
fast until darkness ended the conflict.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">

<p class="pcap">Confederate troops at Chickamauga tried desperately to rout the Federal

<p>In the two-day battle of Chickamauga, 35,000 men were killed,

<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
when he failed to pursue the broken and beaten Federal army. The
Federals were able to reorganize and prepare for a new campaign.
Grant soon arrived at Chattanooga and took command of all Federal
operations in the West. Bragg&rsquo;s Confederates took positions on the
major hills overlooking the city.</p>
<p>From November 23 to 25, the Federals made a series of attacks on
Lookout Mountain, Orchard Knob, and Missionary Ridge. In the end,
and for the first time, Southern soldiers ran in mass panic from a field.
Half-starved Confederate soldiers continued their retreat all the way to
Dalton, Ga. Bragg was finished as a field commander.</p>
<h3 id="c8">1863 IN THE EAST</h3>
<p>On the night of March 8, dapper
John S. Mosby and his Confederate partisan
rangers attacked Fairfax Court House,
Va., only a few miles from Washington.
The most important item bagged at Fairfax
by the Confederates was the garrison
commander, Gen. Edwin Stoughton, who
was captured while asleep in bed.</p>

</div>
<p>From April 29 until May 8, Federal
cavalry under Gen. George Stoneman cut
a swath of destruction through Virginia
almost to Richmond itself. Yet Stoneman&rsquo;s
absence from the Army of the Potomac
helped Lee win perhaps his greatest victory.
Late in April, Gen. Joseph Hooker
started southward toward Richmond with
an army of 133,000 soldiers. His line of
march was through a mass of thick woods and dense undergrowth
known as the Wilderness. There &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson delivered a surprise
flank attack at a road junction called Chancellorsville.</p>
<p>Intense fighting lasted three days and extended from Chancellorsville
ten miles eastward to Fredericksburg. Hooker suffered 17,000
losses. Soon the defeated Federal army was limping up familiar roads
toward Washington.</p>
<p>Over 12,800 Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded at Chancellorsville.
Yet the hardest blow of all was the death of Jackson. Accidentally
shot by his own men, Jackson died of complications on May 10.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s army soon started on a second invasion of the North. Four
reasons prompted this thrust: (1) Southern hopes that Lee might capture
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
an important city such as Harrisburg, Baltimore or Washington,
relieve the pressure on Vicksburg in the West, and possibly effect a
victorious peace; (2) the hope too that a great victory on Northern
soil might cause England to offer mediation in the war; (3) the desire
to transfer the war from ravaged Virginia; and (4) the need to acquire
supplies for Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>With his army at a peak strength of 75,000 men, Lee crossed the
Potomac in mid-June. Lincoln soon replaced Hooker with a Pennsylvanian,
Gen. George G. Meade. By the end of June the 90,000-man
Federal army was moving northward from Maryland into Pennsylvania
in search of the Confederates, who had turned southward in search of
supplies. Advancing from opposite directions, these two mighty forces
collided at Gettysburg, Pa.</p>
<p>For three days (July 1-3) Lee delivered one attack after another.
The climax of the battle came on the afternoon of July 3. Gen. George
Pickett&rsquo;s 15,000 men charged across an open field against the center of
the Federal line. Pickett&rsquo;s assault failed, with 50% casualties, and the
battle ended with this attack. Over 43,000 men were killed, wounded,
or listed as missing at Gettysburg. The Army of the Potomac had won
its first clear-cut victory. Coupled with the fall of Vicksburg on July 4,
this defeat brought Southern morale to a new low.</p>
<p>Lee retreated to Virginia. Both armies took strong positions on
opposite banks of the Rapidan River and awaited possible movements
by one another. Cavalry engagements and infantry skirmishes occupied
most of the remainder of that year.</p>

<h3 id="c9">1864</h3>
<p>In 1864 the Federal war machine moved into high gear. The two
men most responsible were Abraham Lincoln, who on March 9 named
U. S. Grant as supreme army commander, and Grant himself, who made
immediate preparations to strangle the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s master plan was simple: Attack. Federal forces would
attack simultaneously at all points and apply constant pressure on the
ever-weakening Southern states. The Confederacy, Grant reasoned,
could not withstand such a continual onslaught.</p>
<p>Grant went east to campaign with the Army of the Potomac. Gen.
Sherman took over command of the western forces. Federal drives in
both East and West would henceforth proceed from one consistent
strategy. While these two generals mapped out details for their joint
offensive, a third Federal force met defeat in one of the fiascos of the
war. On March 14 Gen. Nathaniel Banks, 40,000 troops, and 50 ships
started up the Red River. Their objectives were to gain control of
Louisiana and East Texas, to counteract threats from the Emperor
Maximilian in Mexico, and to seize large stores of cotton. The expedition
was a failure in every respect.</p>
<p>To make matters worse for the North, Nathan Bedford Forrest
and his Confederate horsemen stormed Fort Pillow, Tenn., on April 12
and killed most of the Negro troops garrisoned there. Sherman dispatched
all available cavalry to rid the West once and for all of the
elusive Forrest. The result was the June 10 battle of Brice&rsquo;s Cross Roads,
Miss., in which Forrest won his greatest victory.</p>
<p>In spite of the activities of such Confederate horsemen as Forrest,
Morgan, Mosby, and Stuart, Grant and Sherman went ahead with their
grand offensives. The main Confederate defenses extended from northwestern
Georgia along the eastern edge of the mountains to Winchester,
Va., thence southeastward across Virginia through Fredericksburg and
Richmond. Early in May both Grant and Sherman struck southward.
Sherman, leading over 100,000 veterans, marched toward the key city
of Atlanta. Grant, with an Army of the Potomac that numbered
118,000 men, retraced Hooker&rsquo;s steps through the Wilderness in a new
&ldquo;On to Richmond&rdquo; drive.</p>
<p>The going proved rough and costly for both generals. Opposing
Sherman were Gen. Joseph Johnston and a reorganized Army of Tennessee.
Johnston realized that his 53,000 ill-equipped soldiers were no
match for a stand-up fight with Sherman&rsquo;s massed divisions. The Confederate
commander therefore resorted to delaying actions and defensive
battles while Sherman tried flanking movements and sharp probes
in an effort to trap Johnston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="300" />
<p class="pcap">In the Federal siege lines around Atlanta, &ldquo;Cump&rdquo; Sherman (legs crossed,
leaning against a Parrott gun) and his aides posed for this photograph.</p>
</div>
<p>By mid-July Sherman had forced Johnston into the trenches of
Atlanta. On July 18 President Davis replaced Johnston with Gen.
John B. Hood, who, although minus a leg and the use of an arm, had a
reputation as a hard fighter. Hood quickly lived up to that reputation.
On July 20, two days after assuming command, Hood attacked Sherman
along Peachtree Creek. The Southerners were repulsed. Two days
later Hood attacked again in East Atlanta. Again the Confederates were
hurled back with heavy losses. Hood then strengthened his defenses
around Atlanta, and Sherman tightened his siege.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grant in Virginia had met with a similar stalemate&mdash;and
at a more terrible cost. Grant encountered no opposition as he
started through the Wilderness toward Lee and Richmond. But as the
Federal army crept through the tangled undergrowth, Lee&rsquo;s 60,000
Confederates struck suddenly and viciously. Two days (May 5-6) of
savage fighting occurred in which Grant met a bloody checkmate.</p>
<p>Yet Grant did not retreat as other generals before him had done.
Instead he unfolded his new and radical policy of hammering at Lee
while edging closer to Richmond. Grant knew that Lee could not
replace his losses, for Southern manpower was all but exhausted. On the
other hand, Grant could draw on the vast
manpower of the north. With Grant the
Civil War was to be a fight to the finish.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="" width="562" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Bitter fighting in the &ldquo;Bloody
Angle&rdquo; at Spotsylvania was
typical of the action in the
six-week Wilderness Campaign
of 1864.</p>
</div>
<p>The Army of the Potomac pushed
stubbornly toward Richmond. Lee tried
desperately to block it, winning victories
at Spotsylvania (May 12), North Anna
(May 23), and Cold Harbor (June 3).
In the last-named engagement, over 7,200
Federals fell in less than twenty minutes
of fighting. While Lee contested Grant&rsquo;s
moves, another and makeshift Confederate
force under Gen. Beauregard repelled a
Federal stab (May 15-19) at Richmond
and Petersburg by Gen. Benjamin Butler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Grant recognized that he could not take Richmond by direct approach.
He shifted his army around the city and moved on Petersburg,
a rail junction and important link in the Confederate chain of
defenses. Lee at first was unaware of Grant&rsquo;s plans to attack Petersburg.
But Beauregard successfully beat back the initial Federal thrusts,
thus forcing Grant to begin what became a nine-month siege of Petersburg.
Many probes were made of Lee&rsquo;s defenses. The most spectacular
of these occurred on July 30 and is known as the Battle of the Crater.</p>
<p>Coal miners in the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry dug a long tunnel
under the Confederate earthworks. Their plan was to explode 8,000
pounds of black powder, blast a mighty gap in the Confederate defenses,
and then to use the resulting confusion for a large-scale Federal
attack.</p>
<p>The explosion and confusion
came off as planned. But the Federal
assault failed. Grant resumed his
tight siege. In the fighting from the
Wilderness to Petersburg, the Federal
army had suffered 60,000 casualties&mdash;more
men than were in Lee&rsquo;s whole
army. Yet Grant knew, as did many
Confederates, that Lee was now
pinned down. The well-equipped and
well-fed Federal army could afford
to wait.</p>

</div>
<p>Other related actions took place
in Virginia. On May 11, Gen. Philip
Sheridan&rsquo;s cavalry clashed with &ldquo;Jeb&rdquo;
Stuart&rsquo;s horsemen a few miles north
of Richmond at Yellow Tavern. Sheridan&rsquo;s men were driven back.
Yet this battle cost the Confederacy the colorful Stuart, mortally
wounded while leading his troops.</p>
<p>On May 15 the Confederates scored another victory in the Shenandoah
Valley. Gen. Franz Siegel and 8,000 Federal horsemen advanced
up the Valley as far as New Market. There they encountered a hastily
assembled Confederate force less than half the size of Siegel&rsquo;s division.
The highlight of the battle was the successful charge of 225 youthful
cadets from the Virginia Military Institute. Siegel&rsquo;s force suffered an
embarrassing defeat and fled down the Valley.</p>
<p>Both Lee and Grant recognized the importance of control of the
Valley. Yet neither could afford to dislodge his army from Petersburg.
Grant therefore organized a separate force under Gen. David Hunter
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
with orders to move into the Valley and &ldquo;to eat up Virginia clear and
clean as far as [you] can go, so that crows flying over it for the balance
of this season will have to carry their provender with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To oppose Hunter, Lee rushed westward a small Confederate army
under Gen. Jubal Early. Hunter burned and looted his way as far as
Lynchburg before Early sent them scurrying over the mountains. Early
then decided to make an invasion of his own. Sweeping down the Valley,
he crossed the Potomac and moved to the outskirts of Washington.
Yet &ldquo;Jubal&rsquo;s Raid&rdquo; (July 4-20) failed when Early decided not to attack
the Northern capital.</p>
<p>Grant resolved that no such threat to Washington would again
occur. He dispatched a large Federal army under Sheridan into the
Valley. Early, woefully outnumbered, nevertheless put up stiff resistance.
Only after victories at Winchester (September 19), Fisher&rsquo;s Hill
(September 22), and Cedar Creek (October 19) could Sheridan declare
the Valley once and for all cleared of Confederate forces.</p>
<p>In Georgia at this time, Sherman was also meeting with success.
Federal victories at Ezra Church (July 28) and Jonesboro (August 31-September
1) compelled Hood to evacuate Atlanta. Sherman occupied
the city on September 2. The fall of Atlanta was a valuable assist to
Lincoln in his reelection to the presidency that autumn.</p>

<p>Sherman felt strongly that the war had to be carried to the Southern
people themselves before the Confederacy would collapse. He therefore
laid plans to slash through the very heart of the South. The campaign
that followed is known as the &ldquo;March to the Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Sherman first sent part of his army
under Gen. Thomas back to Tennessee to
watch Hood, whose Confederates had
moved northward in an effort to force
Sherman from Georgia. With Thomas
blocking Hood, Sherman on November 16
left Atlanta in flames and started toward
the Georgia coast with 68,000 veteran
fighters. Sherman met little opposition
during his advance, and on December 22
he telegraphed Lincoln: &ldquo;I beg to present
you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah,
with 150 heavy guns and plenty
of ammunition, and also about 25,000
bales of cotton.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">Kentucky-born John B. Hood
first gained fame as commander
of a Texas infantry
brigade. He was an excellent
division or corps commander,
but unsuited for the leadership
of an army.</p>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Hood&rsquo;s strategy in Tennessee
backfired tragically. At Franklin,
Tenn., on November 30, Hood hurled his army against a part of
Thomas&rsquo;s force under Gen. John M. Schofield. Hood&rsquo;s assaults cost
6,000 Confederates, including 5 generals and 53 regimental colonels.
Two weeks later, Thomas&rsquo;s troops all but destroyed Hood&rsquo;s army when
the Confederates made repeated assaults at Nashville.</p>
<p>Sherman&rsquo;s strategy had cut the Confederacy in two. Although
Grant was then no closer to Richmond than McClellan had been two
years earlier, all that remained of the Confederacy were Virginia, the
Carolinas, and isolated areas of the Trans-Mississippi.</p>

<h3 id="c10">1865</h3>
<p>After a month&rsquo;s rest at Savannah, Sherman on February 1 started
northward to strike through the Carolinas and join Grant in Virginia
for the final blow against Lee. Sherman&rsquo;s major opposition was the
remnant of the Army of Tennessee, which had been placed again under
the command of Gen. Joseph Johnston.</p>
<p>Johnston could offer but feeble resistance to Sherman. Federal
troops occupied Charleston and were in Columbia when the latter was
gutted by fire. On March 10 Sherman&rsquo;s forces seized Fayetteville in
central North Carolina, brushed back part of Johnston&rsquo;s army six days
later at Averysboro, and successfully withstood a Confederate attack
at Bentonville (March 19-21).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grant had been mustering his forces for a grand drive
against Lee&rsquo;s weak defenses. Throughout the long siege of Petersburg
Grant had slowly extended his lines farther to the south and west. Lee
had no choice but to stretch his own meager defenses accordingly. Soon
the Southern defenses were dangerously overextended.</p>
<p>This was the situation which Grant had sought. On April 1 he
attacked Lee at Five Forks, sixteen miles southwest of Petersburg.
The Confederate line bent and then broke. That night the Army of
Northern Virginia abandoned the Richmond-Petersburg trenches and
slowly moved westward in retreat. At the same time President Davis
transferred the Confederate capital to Danville near the North Carolina
border, Lee&rsquo;s major hope was to rendezvous at Danville with
Johnston&rsquo;s army, then falling back in the face of Sherman&rsquo;s advance.
Together, Lee speculated, he and Johnston might be able to defeat first
Sherman and then Grant.</p>

<p>The dream quickly faded. As Lee&rsquo;s army plodded westward,
Grant&rsquo;s divisions snipped at its heels at Amelia Court House (April
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
4-5), Sailor&rsquo;s Creek (April 6), High Bridge (April 7), and Farmville
(April 7). On April 8, near Appomattox Court House, Lee found the
way blocked by massed infantry and cavalry under Sheridan. The
Confederates were surrounded. On Palm Sunday, April 9, Lee surrendered
to Grant. Three days later, 28,000 Confederates in the Army
of Northern Virginia stacked their muskets before silent lines of Federal
soldiers.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s surrender left Johnston with no place to go. On April 26,
near Durham, N. C., the Army of Tennessee laid down its arms before
Sherman&rsquo;s forces. With the surrender of isolated forces in the Trans-Mississippi
West on May 4, 11, and 26, the most costly war in American
history came to an end.</p>

<p>More Americans died in the Civil War than in all of America&rsquo;s
other wars combined. From the French and Indian wars of the 1750&rsquo;s
through the hostilities in Korea in the 1950&rsquo;s (with the exception of
the Civil War), 606,000 American soldiers died in the line of duty.
In the Civil War alone, over 618,000 men perished in four years of
fighting.</p>
<p>The North lost 360,022 soldiers. Of that number, 67,058 were
killed in action, while 43,012 later died of battle wounds. A total of
275,175 Federals received wounds while fighting.</p>
<p>Accurate records do not exist for the Confederate side. The total
number of Southern soldiers killed was approximately 258,000. About
94,000 were killed or fatally wounded in battle. No figures exist for
the number of Confederates who were wounded in action.</p>
<p>Lord Alfred Tennyson&rsquo;s famous poem,
&ldquo;The Charge of the Light Brigade,&rdquo; tells
of the assault of a British cavalry unit in
the Crimean War. In its charge the Light
Brigade sustained 37% losses. Yet at
Gettysburg on July 2, 1863, the 1st Minnesota
Infantry lost 82% of its strength
in that day&rsquo;s fighting. At Antietam the
1st Texas suffered 82% casualties in a few
hours of combat. The 27th Tennessee had
54% losses at Shiloh; six months later, the
same regiment lost 53% of its remaining
strength at the battle of Perryville. In all
during the Civil War, no less than 63 Federal
and 52 Confederate regiments lost
over 50% of their strength <i>in a single
engagement</i>.</p>

<p>Other statistics of the Civil War give an equally horrible picture.
Over 400,000 soldiers died of sickness and disease. For every man killed
in battle, two men died behind the lines from such maladies as smallpox,
measles, pneumonia, and intestinal disorders. It is a sad fact that almost
as many Federal soldiers (57,265) died of dysentery and diarrhea as
were killed outright on the battlefield (67,058). Since conditions in
Confederate armies were worse, the number of Southern deaths from
sickness was probably higher.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">V. NAVIES</span></h2>
<p>Naval affairs were among the most critical problems facing each
side in 1861. The Federal navy was woefully small and widely scattered.
Moreover, the Confederate seacoast extended 3,500 miles from
the Chesapeake Bay to the Mexican border. It contained hundreds of
inlets, bays, and river openings. Not even a drastically enlarged Federal
navy could patrol so vast a region.</p>
<p>Lincoln and his Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, soon devised
an effective plan. The North would weaken the Confederacy by
blockading its chief ports&mdash;Norfolk, New Bern, Wilmington, Beaufort,
Charleston, Savannah, Pensacola, Mobile, New Orleans, and Galveston.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">

</div>
<p>Lincoln accordingly proclaimed a blockade shortly after war began.
Several months passed before Federal Squadrons could begin to enforce
this blockade. Yet the Federal ring of ships became increasingly stronger
as the war progressed. As a result, Federal forces were able to peck away
at Southern coastal defenses.</p>
<p>In 1861 Union amphibious forces captured Fort Hatteras, N. C.,
and Port Royal, S. C. During the next year Roanoke Island, N. C.,
New Bern, N. C., Fort Pulaski, Ga., Fort Macon, N. C., New Orleans,
La., and Pensacola, Fla., fell into Federal hands in that order. The Confederates
rallied in 1863 and managed to hold their remaining coastal
works, particularly Charleston, S. C.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Northern fleets continued to apply
pressure all along the Southern coast. Two
engagements marked the effectiveness of
coastal attacks. On August 5, 1864, Admiral
David Farragut&mdash;the greatest naval
figure produced by the war&mdash;led his Federal
squadron into mine-infested Mobile
Bay with the battle cry: &ldquo;Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead!&rdquo; Farragut so
neutralized this last Confederate port on
the Gulf of Mexico that its surrender was
an anticlimax. Then, five months later,
on January 15, 1865, Federal forces
stormed and captured Fort Fisher, N. C.,
the last great Southern defense on the Atlantic
coast.</p>

<p class="pcap">David G. Farragut&rsquo;s exploits

</div>
<p>Federal navies also saw much
service on the Mississippi River. A
wide assortment of Federal vessels
campaigned against such Confederate
strongholds as Memphis, Tenn., and
Vicksburg, Miss. Some were little
more than steamboats converted into
warships by means of steel plating
and deck guns. Others were sailing
craft, with high decks and tall masts.
One new type of gunboat made its
appearance on the Mississippi: the
steel ram. Designed by a civilian engineer,
Charles Ellet, Jr., this little
ship had great speed and maneuverability.
Its principal weapon was a
heavy prow, which was used to sink
a ship by striking it broadside.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p19a.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Ellet&rsquo;s steam rams had no
guns and little beauty, but
by their speed they opened
the Mississippi past
Memphis for Federal
movements.</p>
</div>
<p>The Confederacy was born without a navy. Secretary of the Navy
Stephen R. Mallory was never able to develop a fleet that could contest
the ever-increasing Federal navy. Lack of funds, lack of shipbuilding
facilities, and effective Northern diplomacy overseas restricted Confederate
efforts to privateers, to blockade-running, and for the most part,
to undertakings by individual ships.</p>
<p>Most of the twenty Confederate raiders achieved a measure of fame
and success before they were destroyed. For example, the C.S.S. <i>Florida</i>,
under Capt. John Newland Maffitt, captured thirty-four ships before
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
she herself was seized in Brazil in
1864. The English-built <i>Alabama</i>,
commanded by Capt. Raphael Semmes,
compiled a more remarkable
record. In two years on the high seas,
the <i>Alabama</i> took sixty-two prizes.
On June 19, 1864, however, this
Confederate vessel went to the bottom
off the coast of France after an
historic duel with the U.S.S. <i>Kearsage</i>.
Captain James I. Waddell&rsquo;s steam
raider, the <i>Shenandoah</i>, roamed the
Pacific Ocean in quest of Federal
game. Her crew bagged forty ships,
including eight seized two months
after the war on land had ended. On
November 6, 1865, the <i>Shenandoah</i>
furled its Confederate colors in Liverpool, England.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/p19b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="539" />
<p class="pcap">In their famous battle, the
<i>Alabama</i> (right) and
<i>Kearsage</i> circled and fired
for an hour at a range of
900 yards. The <i>Alabama</i>

</div>
<p>The most famous Civil War contest between ships occurred March
9, 1862, in Hampton Roads, Va. The Confederates had raised from the
bottom of Norfolk harbor the Federal warship, <i>Merrimac</i>. John Mercer
Brooke and John L. Porter had then converted the craft into an ironclad
vessel which the Confederates rechristened the <i>Virginia</i>. Sloping
iron plates four inches thick protected her decks. The ironclad carried
a battering ram weighing 1,500 pounds, plus ten guns. On March 8
the <i>Virginia</i> steamed into Hampton Roads. She easily destroyed two
wooden Federal warships and ran a third aground.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/p19d.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="357" />
<p class="pcap">The <i>Monitor</i> (left) was the creation of Swedish-born John Ericsson, who had
difficulty in selling his strange vessel to the Federal navy. The re-christened
<i>Merrimac</i> (right) carried more guns, but so difficult was the ship to maneuver
that it required 30 minutes to turn it around.</p>
</div>
<p>On the following day, however, the North came forward with a
revolutionary weapon of its own. This was the <i>Monitor</i>, so weird-looking
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
a craft that sailors referred to it as a &ldquo;tin can on a shingle.&rdquo;
The three-hour battle between the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Virginia</i> was a
draw. Neither ship could pierce the plating of the other. Yet this
indecisive battle caused a revolution in naval craft, for it foreshadowed
the day when wooden ships would be obsolete.</p>
<p>Two months later, trapped in Hampton Roads, the <i>Virginia</i> was
run aground and destroyed. In December, 1862, the <i>Monitor</i> went
down in an Atlantic storm near the North Carolina coast.</p>
<p>The Confederates made several notable innovations in the field of
naval warfare.</p>
<p>One was an ironclad ram that had the appearance and characteristics
of a monster. This was the <i>Arkansas</i>, which the Confederates
somehow put together in the summer of 1862 to combat Federal ships
on the Mississippi. Constructed of wood, railroad rails, wire, and bits
and pieces of iron collected from all over the South, the <i>Arkansas</i> scattered
several Federal gunboats, created panic on the Mississippi, and
managed to survive a heavy Federal bombardment near Vicksburg.</p>
<p>At Baton Rouge, however, the ironclad&rsquo;s engines failed. The ram&rsquo;s
commander, Lieutenant H. K. Stevens, ordered the helpless ship destroyed.
The <i>Arkansas</i> enjoyed only one month of action; yet Federal
Admiral David Farragut called the end of the <i>Arkansas</i> &ldquo;one of the
happiest moments of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Confederacy also had the first submarine of modern design.
Built in 1863 at Mobile, the <i>H. L. Hunley</i> was named for its inventor.
In the process of its trial runs, the thirty-five-foot vessel sank four
times and drowned as many crews. Nevertheless,
the <i>Hunley</i> was borne overland to
Charleston, S. C., to campaign against a
fleet of Federal blockaders. On the night
of February 17, 1864, the little submarine
torpedoed and sank the Federal warship,
<i>Housatonic</i>. But the <i>Hunley</i> and its fifth
crew of seven men perished in the explosion.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">

<p class="pcap">This Official U. S. Navy
photograph shows the Confederate
torpedo boat
<i>David</i> aground in Charleston
harbor. Semi-submersible,
the <i>David</i> is often
called a submarine.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to the submarine, Confederates
also developed the water mine
and the torpedo boat. The latter was a
small vessel, propelled by a steam engine.
It drifted along the surface of the water
and attacked enemy ships with a torpedo
suspended from a long spar. The first of
these torpedo boats, the <i>David</i>, appeared in
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Charleston harbor early in October, 1863, and seriously damaged the
blockading warship, <i>New Ironsides</i>.</p>
<p>But such innovations could not overcome the constant and painful
pressure of large Federal fleets all along the Southern coast. So vital
were the navies to the Northern war effort, James G. Randall wrote,
&ldquo;that Union victory without the naval contribution seems inconceivable.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">VI. DIPLOMACY</span></h2>
<p>What the nations of Europe did&mdash;or did not do&mdash;were matters of
constant and vital concern to both North and South during the Civil
War. President Davis and other Confederate officials hoped earnestly
that England, and possibly France as well, would recognize the independence
of the Southern nation and grant it much-needed aid. President
Lincoln and the Federal authorities were just as desirous that
European powers should not intervene in the American struggle. Thus,
starting in 1861, both sides began a determined tug-of-war to woo the
statesmen of Europe to their respective cause.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig42">

</div>
<p>The first major international incident occurred in the autumn
of 1861 and is known as the &ldquo;Trent Affair&rdquo;. Two Confederate commissioners,
James M. Mason and John Slidell, were sent to plead the
South&rsquo;s cause at London and Paris, respectively. The agents were
en route on the British mail steamer, <i>Trent</i>, when, on November 8,
a Federal warship, the <i>San Jacinto</i>, stopped the British vessel on the
high seas. Mason and Slidell were removed from the <i>Trent</i> and
imprisoned at Fort Warren in Boston.</p>
<p>Northern officials were unprepared for the storm of indignation
that came from England. The <i>San Jacinto</i>, it was pointed out, had
violated English neutrality by intercepting the <i>Trent</i>. Equally
outrageous to the British was the fact that the <i>San Jacinto</i> had fired
two warning shots across the <i>Trent&rsquo;s</i> bow. This was equivalent to
firing at the British flag; as such, it constituted an act of war against
England.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Fortunately for the North, Lincoln
and his Secretary of State, William H.
Seward, were able to resolve the incident
with a minimum of ill feelings. Apologies
were dispatched to London. Mason and
Slidell were released from prison and
allowed to continue their overseas journey
without further Federal interference.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition to Mason and Slidell, the
Confederacy utilized a number of foreign
agents. Most of these commissioners pursued
a policy of &ldquo;King Cotton diplomacy&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, promising England and France
large quantities of the popular staple in
return for official recognition of, and active
aid to, the Southern Confederacy.
When the demand for American cotton dropped sharply in Europe,
this approach failed.</p>
<p>Southern agents Henry Hotze, Edwin DeLeon, and James D.
Bulloch then tried new strategy. They wrote extensively about the
close ties in business and society between the English aristocracy and
the great Southern planters, a lower tariff on foreign-made goods if
the Confederacy triumphed in the war, and a more active European
participation in American commerce.</p>
<p>The nations in Europe had other
reasons for wishing to assist the Southern
cause. The Federal blockade prevented
English goods from reaching eager
Southern markets. Many persons abroad
looked on the Civil War as a struggle of
the South for the right of self-determination.
On the other hand, the British
middle and working classes detested
slavery. After Lincoln&rsquo;s Emancipation,
most Europeans believed that the North
was waging a great struggle for freedom.</p>

it was largely unsuccessful. British and
French shipbuilders did sell several vessels
to the Confederate government. Yet this
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
aid dropped to a thin trickle following Lincoln&rsquo;s Emancipation

to the Confederacy could occasion war
with the United States. Adams fought a
host of Southern agents around the diplomatic
tables of Europe. &ldquo;When all the

character and ability of Charles Francis
Adams were as valuable as Union military
victories in contributing to ultimate
success in the war.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">VII. PRISONS AND PRISONERS OF WAR</span></h2>
<p>The Civil War was the first time that the nation had to contend
with large numbers of war prisoners. As might be expected, therefore,
policies and treatment varied greatly&mdash;and oftentimes sadly.</p>
<p>During the war the Confederates captured about 211,000 Federal
soldiers. Of this number, 16,000 agreed to battlefield paroles&mdash;signed
promises that they would not bear arms again. Conversely, Federal
forces took some 215,000 Confederates as prisoners. At various times
throughout the war, both sides made efforts to establish a workable
program of prisoner exchange. (A ratio of exchange once existed
whereby forty privates equalled one major-general.) However, owing
to misunderstandings, violations of terms, and Grant&rsquo;s determination
late in the war to bring the South to its knees at all costs, prisoner
exchange was slight and sporadic.</p>
<p>The most notorious Southern prisons were: Libby and Castle
Thunder, which were converted warehouses in Richmond; Belle Isle
in the James River; &ldquo;Camp Sorghum&rdquo; at Columbia, S. C.; and Camp
Sumter at Andersonville, Ga. Among the worst of the Northern
compounds were: Elmira Prison Camp in southwestern New York
State; Point Lookout, on the Chesapeake Bay; Johnson&rsquo;s Island, in
Lake Erie a few miles offshore from Ohio; Camp Douglas, near Chicago;
and Rock Island Prison Camp, Illinois.</p>
<p>Writing of these compounds in general, one historian has
observed: &ldquo;The prisons of the Civil War were of a considerable variety
in structure and general make-up and for the most part consisted of
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
temporary structures or old unused buildings not originally intended
to confine prisoners. Most of them, judged by present-day standards
of sanitation and safety, would have been condemned as uninhabitable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">

<p class="pcap">A <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i> artist sketched an orderly and clean Elmira
Prison that was a far cry from actual conditions. For a modest sum, curious
townspeople were permitted to mount observation towers and view the prisoners.</p>
</div>
<p>Small wonder that great suffering existed in most prison camps,
both North and South. In the nine-month history of the huge prison
at Andersonville, Ga., a total of 45,613 Federals were jammed into
a Stockade containing one polluted stream of water, few shelters, less
food, and no sanitation. Over 12,900 prisoners died of disease, exposure,
and starvation at Andersonville. Confederate authorities maintained
that Federal prisoners in Andersonville received the same slim food
ration as did their guards, and that the whole South suffered badly for
want of medicines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/p23c.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Only captured Federal officers
were confined in Libby Prison.
Several escapes, and innumerable
charges of inhuman treatment,
marked this compound&rsquo;s
four-year history.</p>
</div>
<p>The North&rsquo;s prison camp
at Elmira, N. Y., had many
similarities to Andersonville.
This Federal compound existed
for a year. During that time,
2,963 of 12,123 Confederate
prisoners died from various
causes. In the twenty-month
life of Rock Island Prison Camp,
1,960 of 12,400 Southern inmates
succumbed to exposure
and disease. At six remote
tobacco warehouses in Danville,
Virginia, 1,400 of 7,000 Federal
prisoners died of smallpox, malnutrition,
and intestinal disorders
in the space of a year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>In all, the Chief of the U. S. Record and Pension Office reported
in 1903, 25,976 Confederates and 30,218 Federals died in Civil War
prisons.</p>
<p>It is difficult still to give an accurate and impartial summary of
Civil War prisons. Conflicting facts, lost records, and bitter feelings
hamper attempts to arrive at a just verdict. But perhaps Prof.
James Ford Rhodes was not far from the truth when he stated: &ldquo;All
things considered the statistics show no reason why the North should
reproach the South [about atrocious prison conditions]. If we add
to one side of the account the refusal to exchange the prisoners and
the greater resources, and to the other the distress of the Confederacy,
the balance struck will not be far from even. Certain it is that no
deliberate intention existed either in Richmond or Washington to
inflict suffering on captives more than inevitably accompanied their
confinement.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ARTILLERY</h3>
<p>About forty-eight different types and sizes of cannons were used
in the Civil War. Identifying a particular weapon thus requires
knowing such facts as the name of the gun, howitzer, rifle or mortar;
whether it was a smoothbore (without rifling in the barrel) or a
rifled gun (with barrel groovings), etc.</p>
<p>The two most popular cannons in the Civil War were the
12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore howitzer and the 10-pounder Parrott
rifled field gun.</p>
<p>The Napoleon weighed
about 1,200 pounds, fired a
12-pound spherical shell with
a time fuse, and was very
effective up to a range of
1,500 yards. The Parrott
rifle&mdash;identifiable by a reinforced
barrel seat&mdash;weighed
900 pounds. At a maximum
range elevation of 12&deg;, this
piece was accurate to 3,000-3,500
yards (1&frac34;-2 miles).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">

<p class="pcap">A Negro soldier stands guard over a
Napoleon gun at Grant&rsquo;s City Point,
Va., supply-base. The Napoleon is

ammunition.</p>
</div>
<p>The Federals also made
extensive use of mortars.
Because of the ability of
these squat, heavy weapons
to lob large shells a great
distance by high-angle fire, mortars were ideal for siege operations.</p>
<p>Artillerists used various types of shells, depending upon the action
in which they were engaged. Solid shot was good for battering a
fortification or for striking an enemy column in flank. Explosive
shells and &ldquo;spherical case&rdquo; blanketed an area with what is known today
as shrapnel. Canister, a shell filled with lead balls about the size of
plums, was deadly for close action up to 300 yards. Somewhat similar
to canister was grape shot. This type of shell, filled with balls the
size of oranges, was effective to 700 yards. Yet grape shot was rarely
used in land warfare.</p>
<p>The basic artillery unit was known as a battery. It normally
consisted of 4-6 guns commanded by a captain. In battle, batteries
normally supported infantry divisions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<div class="img" id="fig54">
<img src="images/p24a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="401" />
<p class="pcap">A popular field piece among Confederates was the 12-pounder, breech-loading
Whitworth gun. Made in England, these weapons fired a solid shot accurately
to a range of 5 miles.</p>
</div>
<p>During the conflict of the 1860&rsquo;s the North experimented with
and used many new types of field weapons, including the machine gun
and such cannons as Rodmans, Columbiads, and Dahlgrens. Despite
the large variety, however, the Napoleons and Parrotts remained the
&ldquo;old reliables&rdquo; to gunners on both sides.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig55">
<img src="images/p24c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="362" />
<p class="pcap">Mortars were very effective during bombardments or siege operations. The most
famous of these squat, heavy weapons was the &ldquo;Dictator&rdquo; (shown above). Used
during Grant&rsquo;s 1864 siege of Petersburg, this mortar fired a 200-pound ball at
distances over 2 miles.</p>
</div>
<h3>SMALL ARMS</h3>
<p>The weapon most used by Civil War infantrymen was known
officially as the United States Rifle Musket, Model 1861. Soldiers
popularly called it the &ldquo;Springfield&rdquo;, since the Springfield, Mass.,
arsenal manufactured a majority of these guns.</p>
<p>The Springfield was a percussion-cap, muzzle-loading weapon,
caliber .58, and weighed 9&frac34; pounds. The Springfield&rsquo;s effective range
was 500 yards, although it could deliver a ball twice that distance.
It fired a soft lead Minie bullet&mdash;known then as now as the &ldquo;minnie
ball.&rdquo; In all, over 670,000 Springfields were manufactured during the
Civil War. They cost the government about $19 each.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="161" />
<p class="pcap">The Springfield musket, not including its 18-inch bayonet, was 58&frac12; inches in
length. Contrary to popular belief, Civil War soldiers rarely used bayonets in
battle.</p>
</div>
<p>Very popular among soldiers on both sides was the English Enfield
Rifle Musket, Model 1853. About 820,000 of these rifles were purchased
by North and South. The Enfield weighed 9 pounds, 3 ounces,
had a caliber of .577, and was deadly up to 800 yards. It fired a bullet
similar to the Minie projectile.</p>
<p>Great strides were made at this time in breechloaders. These
weapons fired ready-made bullets, a series of which were inserted at
one time in the rear of the barrel. Breechloaders could fire faster
and more accurately than the single-shot, muzzle-loading Springfield
or Enfield. The Spencer Repeating Carbine, first patented in 1860,
was a seven-shot repeater that weighed 8&frac14; pounds and had an
effective range of 2,000 yards. The Spencer was capable of 15 shots
per minute&mdash;three times the firepower of the Springfield. Another
popular carbine among Federal soldiers was the 15-shot Henry
repeater, which was a .42-caliber, rimfire carbine of extraordinary
accuracy. About 10,000 of these weapons saw service in the Civil War.
This gun was the forerunner of the modern Winchester carbine.
Unfortunately for the North, red tape and political conservatism by
its leaders prohibited the wide and prompt adoption of the repeating
rifle.</p>
<p>The principal hand gun for
cavalry and infantry officers was the
Colt Army Revolver, Model 1860.
Over 100,000 of these six-shot, .44-caliber
revolvers were manufactured
during the war. This same gun, in
.36 caliber, was also made for the
U. S. Navy. In addition, some twenty
other types of pistols were used by
soldiers of blue and gray.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p25a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="235" />
<p class="pcap">In 1836 twenty-two-year-old
Samuel Colt patented
and produced the first of
his famous handguns. The
.44 caliber 1860 model,
shown above, was known
officially as the New Model
Army Pistol.</p>

<p class="pcap">Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) and Jefferson Davis
(1808-1889) were born in Kentucky only a few miles
apart. Lincoln educated himself, eventually settled
in Illinois, and became a highly successful frontier attorney.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/p26a.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Davis graduated from West Point, became a wealthy Mississippi
planter, and served successively as Secretary of War
and U. S. senator. Both men were tall and of striking
appearance; both married strong-willed women.</p>
</div>
<p>The destiny of Civil War America lay largely in the hands of
four men: Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Ulysses Simpson Grant,
and Robert Edward Lee. Since an abundance of printed works exists
on the lives and careers of these leaders, given here are but a few
generalities concerning each.</p>
<p>In many respects, Lincoln long seemed mysteriously complex.
But those who knew the man quickly dropped any impression that
Lincoln was crude or provincial. &ldquo;He is the best of us all,&rdquo; his Secretary
of State, William H. Seward, once stated. The solemn-looking Lincoln
was a deeply earnest chief executive who devoted his last four years
to reuniting a shattered nation that he loved dearly and to raising
the nation to a higher moral and spiritual level. He was kind, genial,
compassionate, and religious (though he attended church without
joining any denomination).</p>
<p>Lincoln possessed several ingredients of greatness. He had a deep
love of humanity, a keen understanding of men, and a fantastic
patience with the generals and politicians who tried him by their
lack of strength and capacity. He was also a man of total integrity
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
and deep humility. As a patriot he
believed firmly that &ldquo;this government of
the people, by the people, and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.&rdquo;
Not once in those years of passion did he
express the slightest hatred for the Union&rsquo;s
enemies. In his second inaugural address,
delivered a month before his death in 1865,
Lincoln closed by stating: &ldquo;With malice
toward none, with charity for all, with
firmness in the right as God gives us to
see the right, let us continue the work we
are in ... [and] do all that may achieve
a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves,
and with all nations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">
<img src="images/p26c.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="700" />
<p class="pcap">On July 7, 1865, four persons
convicted of conspiracy
in the assassination of
Lincoln were hanged at
the Washington Arsenal.
Among the four was Mrs.
Mary Surratt (second from
left), the first woman in
America to be executed for
a capital offense.</p>
</div>
<p>Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy,
deserves better treatment than
history has accorded him. The years have
not been kind to his memory for two reasons: 1) he led the losing side;
2) when compared to his Northern counterpart, Lincoln, Davis left
much to be desired in both personality and statesmanship. Unlike
Lincoln, Davis was handsome, well-educated, and experienced in
political and military affairs. However, he lacked administrative skill.
He tried to do all of the government&rsquo;s work&mdash;and he was a slow
worker. Worst of all, Davis was never able to gain the affection of
his people in a degree remotely approaching the love heaped on Lincoln
by the North.</p>
<p>Yet Davis did his best in an impossible job. He was harassed and
criticized by jealous governors, independent generals, an apathetic
vice-president, and a Confederate Congress more noted for constant
arguing than for constructive activity. Ever-present from without
was an enemy that heavily outweighed the South in resources.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Davis was in a sense doomed to failure from the start, but his devotion
to the South never wavered. In spite of many physical handicaps,
he demonstrated throughout his life honesty, courage, fortitude, and a
firmness in the right as <i>he</i> saw the right. In sectional terms, he may be
adjudged one of the true patriots in American history.</p>
<p>Military analysts often assert that U. S. Grant was &ldquo;the first of the
modern generals&rdquo; and that Robert E. Lee was &ldquo;the last of the old-fashioned
generals.&rdquo; What this implies is that two able field commanders
fought one another differently: Grant introducing all-out, total
war, Lee relying on a 500-year-old concept of limited warfare.</p>
<p>Certainly Grant was original in much of his strategy. To him
a single victory meant very little. The long-range result of a continual
hammering was the important factor. &ldquo;The art of war is simple
enough,&rdquo; he once stated. &ldquo;Find out where your enemy is. Get at him
as soon as you can. Strike at him hard as you can, and keep moving
on.&rdquo; Grant&rsquo;s aggression, therefore, became attrition&mdash;that is, a skillful,
systematic grinding down of the South&rsquo;s whole capacity to fight. War
under Grant became modern war: all-inclusive and brutal. He meant
it that way, for he always thought of war as a cruel, bloody business to
be ended as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="pcap">Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885) was born in Ohio, entered the
Civil War from Illinois, and spent his last years in New York. He
served two terms as 18th President of the U. S. Grant completed
his memoirs only a week before his death from throat cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig64">
<img src="images/p27a.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="701" />
<p class="pcap">Robert E. Lee (1807-1870) was the son of Virginia&rsquo;s Revolutionary
War hero, &ldquo;Lighthorse Harry&rdquo; Lee. Following a distinguished
army career, Lee became president of impoverished Washington
College (now Washington and Lee University).</p>
</div>
<p>This short, unimpressive looking general succeeded where others had
failed because he had the willingness to give an order and the strength
to see it carried out. He did not use the lightning tactics of
Napoleon or Lee. Yet he had the determination and stubbornness
to keep plodding after the enemy. He was thus a soldier
of the mold of Frederick the Great and the Duke of Wellington. Perhaps Lincoln best
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
summed up Grant when he answered criticisms of the general with the
observation: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spare this man. He fights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert E. Lee has two historical handicaps: 1) he fought against
the Union; and 2) he is the only American general who ever lost a war.
Yet practically everyone who studies the life of this devoted Virginian
soon agrees with Sir Winston Churchill, who termed Lee &ldquo;one of the
noblest Americans who ever lived, and one of the greatest captains
known to the annals of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee is most remembered for an almost flawless character. He did
not believe in slavery, but his heart and birthright were in Virginia.
Therefore, he turned down command of all U. S. forces in 1861 and
offered his services to his native state. As an army commander Lee
usually displayed great boldness in action, an ingenious capacity for
choosing the right field positions, and an uncanny ability to anticipate
his opponent&rsquo;s next move. With faith in his own judgment and in the
fighting quality of his army, Lee would then devise his strategy.
Confederate politics forced Lee to fight for the most part on the
defensive, and many writers attribute the Southern nation&rsquo;s long life
to Lee&rsquo;s genius in combating an enemy that sometimes greatly outnumbered
him.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s chief weaknesses as a general were his depthless humility and
courtesy. Too often he entrusted to his principal lieutenants decisions
he himself should have made. He seemed always to assume that everyone
around him would strive for victory as earnestly and as completely
as he did. Much of this devotion to principle did rub off on his army.
One of Lee&rsquo;s sharpest critics eventually admitted: &ldquo;Few generals have
been able to animate an army as [Lee&rsquo;s] self-sacrificing idealism
animated the Army of Northern Virginia.... What this bootless,
ragged, half-starved army accomplished is one of the miracles of
history.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">X. THE COMMON SOLDIERS</span></h2>
<p>The average Civil War soldier was a farm boy between 18 and
30 years of age. He possessed little formal education; and by modern-day
standards, his military training was superficial. He was more
fighter than soldier, and he tended to scoff at military discipline and
other formalities of army service.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig65">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="357" />
<p class="pcap">Posing for photographs to send home to loved ones was a favorite pastime of
Civil War soldiers. Typical servicemen of that period were, from left to right:
Pvt. George A. Stryker of New York,
Pvt. John W. Branch of the 12th Tennessee (C.S.A.), and
Pvt. Philip Carper of the 35th Virginia Cavalry.</p>
</div>
<p>Several factors prompted his voluntary entrance into the army.
Intense patriotism, the determination to fight for one&rsquo;s particular cause,
the enticement of enlistment bounties, or the simple love of adventure
were all strong inducements. Many men, however, were drafted into
service when both sides resorted to conscription in 1862.</p>
<p>In that same year the North began organizing regiments of ex-slaves.
The first Negro regiment to perform conspicuous service was
Col. Robert Gould Shaw&rsquo;s 54th Massachusetts, which suffered heavy
losses in a July 18, 1863, assault on Fort Wagner, S. C. In all, about
186,000 Negroes became Federal soldiers. They served under white
officers and often suffered discrimination in such matters as pay and
bounties. Yet they proved courageous fighters in several of the battles
in which they participated.</p>
<p>Conversely, Confederate officials were slow to use slaves as Southern
soldiers. Many feared an uprising once the Negroes were given
arms; others opposed the use of slaves as soldiers on grounds that the
Negro was ill-prepared for such high responsibility. Not until March,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
1865, when the war was almost over,
did the Confederate government authorize
the formation of Negro regiments.
While some units were mustered
into service, none were sent into combat.</p>
<p>To become a soldier, a man
normally joined a military company
being raised in his own locality. This
company then went to a state training
camp and joined similar units preparing
for war. At the completion of basic
training, ten companies were banded
together as a regiment and mustered
into national service. Orders came soon
thereafter assigning the regiment to
duty in the field.</p>

</div>
<p>The Federal private received $13 per month and a clothing
allowance of $42 annually. Customarily, his uniform was dark blue
and consisted of a kepi (a cap that slants toward the front), heavy
wool coat, and lighter colored trousers. His prescribed equipment
included rifle, ammunition, knapsack, blanket, haversack, canteen,
bayonet, and cartridge box. The Federal lived mostly in a tent, cooked
his meals with his messmates, and was personally responsible for the
good condition of his equipment.</p>
<p>His Confederate counterpart was not so well provided. In
addition to his musket, he normally carried a blanket slung over one
shoulder, canteen, knife, and cartridge box. Gray was the color of
the official Confederate uniform. However, few of the soldiers were
uniformly clad after the first months of service. Many wore instead
clothing taken from dead or captured Federals, or made at home and
dyed in a solution of walnut hulls. The home-dyed uniform was light
brown, or &ldquo;butternut&rdquo;, in color. Few tents existed in Confederate
armies. Southern soldiers thus
became accustomed to camping
in the open. The Confederate
private received $11
monthly until 1864, when his
pay was raised to $18 because
of widespread Southern inflation.</p>

Rappahannock Station, Va., in March, 1864. In the foreground
is a sutler&rsquo;s tent. The fence marks the stockade of
the 50th New York Engineers.</p>
</div>
<p>The Federal soldier received much better rations
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
than did the Confederate. His bread was a thick cracker called &ldquo;hardtack&rdquo;,
and many jokes were made over its toughness. The Union soldier
also received meat, dried vegetables, coffee, sugar, and salt. The Confederate
soldier, unable to get coffee because of the blockade, learned to
use beans, rye, parched corn, and even acorns as substitutes. Rarely did
Southern troops have ample food. Personal accounts by Confederates
often reveal pitiful instances of widespread malnutrition in the ranks.</p>
<p>For recreation, each soldier was left to his own devices. Letter-writing,
reading, singing, card-playing, and sleeping were the favorite
pastimes of troops in camp. In winter men on both sides constructed
huts of logs and mud, or piled dirt against the sides of their tents
as insulation from the cold. Reveille normally sounded at 5 a.m. in
summer and 6 a.m. in winter. &ldquo;Taps&rdquo;, a melody first played in 1862,
generally came between 10 and 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Fighting in the Civil War was
generally savage, and guerrillas on both
sides often killed in cold blood. Yet
when opposing armies were camped close
to one another, it was not at all uncommon
for blue and gray pickets to
establish informal truces, swap newspapers,
tobacco, and coffee, and even to
camp together. Sometimes this fraternization
might last through an entire
winter. Even in battle, many soldiers
on both sides displayed great compassion&mdash;even
to the extent of risking their
lives in order to help a stricken foe.
Sergeant Richard Kirkland of South
Carolina was so overcome at the mounting
Federal casualties during the battle
of Fredericksburg that he crawled out
upon the battlefield and voluntarily gave
aid to dozens of wounded Northerners.</p>

</div>
<p>Yet army life of the 1860&rsquo;s had many and severe hardships.
Improper diet and insanitary conditions often prostrated half of a
unit&rsquo;s membership. Since filth abounded in every army, a soldier who
did not have his share of lice and fleas was a rare exception. Moreover,
the fact that a majority of the soldiers were from rural communities
made them very susceptible to such &ldquo;city sicknesses&rdquo; as measles, chicken
pox, and small pox. The death rate from these diseases were very high.
In the Federal armies, sickness and disease accounted for 7 of every
10 deaths. One authority has estimated that among the Confederates
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
three men perished from disease for every man killed in battle. Small
wonder that a Civil War soldier once wrote his family from camp:
&ldquo;It scares a man to death to get sick down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soldiers suffered too because of the limited medical knowledge of
that day. Blood transfusions, X-rays, antibiotics, sterilization, vitamins,
vaccines, wonder drugs all came after the Civil War. No assured treatment
existed for typhoid fever, yellow fever, measles, or pneumonia,
and great uncertainty prevailed over the proper way to stop a hemorrhage.
Most bone fractures, and all wounds of the joint, meant amputation.
In the Korean conflict of the 1950&rsquo;s the chances of surviving a
wound were 50-1; in the Civil War the chances were only 7-1.</p>
<p>That men of blue and gray endured these miseries is proof enough
of their amazing capacity for hardships. Of greater importance to our
American heritage, however, was their courage and devotion to duty.
It shone forth on each side, and in every battle. Bell Irvin Wiley has
commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Civil War was in large degree a soldier&rsquo;s war. In that war
the determination, self-sufficiency, and endurance of the individual in
the ranks were of utmost importance. Officer casualties were heavy,
and in the hurly-burly of combat those who survived often were able
to exercise little control over their units. In the crucial, climactic stages
of battle the common soldiers were to a large extent on their own, and
it was often their courage and tenacity, individual and collective, that
ultimately decided the contest.... For it was these men and their
kind whose strength was the bedrock of their respective causes and
whose greatness made their war one of the most inspiring in the history
of embattled humanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was necessary for brother to fight brother to determine
the course in history our nation would take. Tragedy often walks with
greatness; it required a terrible war before America could continue with
confidence down the road of progress. The Civil War was the watershed&mdash;both
a beginning and an end&mdash;in our history, and many legacies
of that war keep it ever-present in our thoughts.</p>
<p>The Civil War lives in battle names now so much a part of our
heritage: Bull Run, Shiloh, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Stone&rsquo;s River,
Chancellorsville, Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, Atlanta, the
Wilderness, and the Crater. These grounds, drenched in human blood,
are as sacred as our most revered cemeteries.</p>
<p>&mdash;It lives in the crosses that mark the final resting places for
thousands of American patriots. Most of these soldiers died in the
flower of youth. We shall never know what contributions their numbers
might have made to politics, literature, the sciences, the arts&mdash;to
American life in general. In this respect was the conflict of the 1860&rsquo;s
a great calamity.</p>

<p>&mdash;It lives in the Congressional Medal of
Honor, given birth by that war, and in Memorial
Day, which sprang from the heartache
caused by that war.</p>
<p>&mdash;It lives in the American Red Cross,
whose origins date from Clara Barton and her
tender nursing of wounded Federal soldiers.</p>
<p>&mdash;It lives in the songs given popularity
by men of blue and gray: &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Battle Hymn of the Republic,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bonnie
Blue Flag,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Battle Cry of Freedom,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lorena,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Yellow Rose of Texas,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Maryland, My Maryland,&rdquo; &ldquo;When Johnny

<p class="pcap">This 1862 Army Model

is quite different from its
predecessor.</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;It lives in the extinction of slavery, which Robert E. Lee once
termed a heavy impediment to the whole Southern people.</p>
<p>&mdash;It lives in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments
to the U. S. Constitution, which promise equality without racial
limitations.</p>
<p>&mdash;It lives most of all in the unity of the American people. Until
1860 it was customary to say &ldquo;the United States are&rdquo;. After 1865 it
was more correct to say &ldquo;the United States is&rdquo;. Today we acknowledge
this change by a phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance: &ldquo;... one nation,
under God, indivisible....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Civil War did preserve the old Union with all of its virtues
and all of its defects. But at the same time, as Lincoln and others
hoped, the war gave birth to something better: a new Union, stronger
and more enduring. The idea of secession ended forever with the
Southern Confederacy; the oneness of modern America became reality
with Appomattox and Durham Station.</p>
<p>Therefore, one cannot and should not forget the tragedy, courage,
and lessons of the Civil War. If we would overlook the 1860&rsquo;s that
endowed us with unity, we must also ignore the 1770&rsquo;s that brought
us freedom. For unity and freedom are the bedrocks on which America
rests&mdash;just as they are our hopes for the years yet to come.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
